The `cratedb-fivetran-destination` package implements the [CrateDB destination
adapter for Fivetran]. It works with both [CrateDB] and [CrateDB Cloud].

Feel free to use the adapter as provided or else modify / extend it
as appropriate for your own applications. We appreciate contributions of any kind.

## Introduction

CrateDB is a distributed and scalable SQL database for storing and analyzing
massive amounts of data in near real-time, even with complex queries.
It is PostgreSQL-compatible, and based on Lucene.

Fivetran is an automated data movement platform. Automatically, reliably and
securely move data from 650+ sources including SaaS applications, databases,
ERPs, and files to data warehouses, data lakes, and more.

## Requirements

The package is based on [CrateDB's SQLAlchemy dialect] package.
It will be automatically installed when installing the Fivetran adapter.

You can run [CrateDB Self-Managed] or start using [CrateDB Cloud],
see [CrateDB Installation], or [CrateDB Cloud Console].

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install --upgrade cratedb-fivetran-destination
```

## Usage

Start gRPC destination server. Note the parameters are optional.
```bash
cratedb-fivetran-destination --port=50052 --max-workers=1
```

## OCI

You can use the OCI image [ghcr.io/crate/cratedb-fivetran-destination] at your
disposal. CI is building image variants for each pr, each night, and for
GA releases.
```bash
docker run --rm --publish=50052:50052 ghcr.io/crate/cratedb-fivetran-destination:nightly
```

## Project Information

### Acknowledgements
Kudos to the authors of all the many software components this library is
inheriting from and building upon.

### Contributing
The `cratedb-fivetran-destination` package is an open source project, and is
[managed on GitHub]. We appreciate contributions of any kind.

### Status

The adapter is still in its infancy and needs exposure to remedy teething
problems.

On its next iterations, we will evaluate if the encoding (column mapping) style
needs to be adjusted, and if the type mapping needs improvements.
Also, a few more other details around recommendations from the [Fivetran SDK
Development Guide] will be improved.


### License
The project uses the Apache license, like CrateDB itself.

The `cratedb-fivetran-destination` package implements the [CrateDB destination
adapter for Fivetran]. It works with both [CrateDB] and [CrateDB Cloud].

Feel free to use the adapter as provided or else modify / extend it
as appropriate for your own applications. We appreciate contributions of any kind.

## Introduction

CrateDB is a distributed and scalable SQL database for storing and analyzing
massive amounts of data in near real-time, even with complex queries.
It is PostgreSQL-compatible, and based on Lucene.

Fivetran is an automated data movement platform. Automatically, reliably and
securely move data from 650+ sources including SaaS applications, databases,
ERPs, and files to data warehouses, data lakes, and more.

## Requirements

The package is based on [CrateDB's SQLAlchemy dialect] package.
It will be automatically installed when installing the Fivetran adapter.

You can run [CrateDB Self-Managed] or start using [CrateDB Cloud],
see [CrateDB Installation], or [CrateDB Cloud Console].

## Installation

```bash
pip install --upgrade cratedb-fivetran-destination
```

## Usage

Start gRPC destination server.
```bash
python -m cratedb_fivetran_destination.main
```

## Status

The adapter is still in its infancy and needs exposure to remedy teething
problems. On its next iterations, we will evaluate if the encoding style
needs to be adjusted, and if the type mapping needs adjustments. We will
also take care about a few more other details around easing deployment.
